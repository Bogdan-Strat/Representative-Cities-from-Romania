  <dt style="font-size:20px;"><strong>1. Peles Castle</strong></dt>
  <dd>Nestled at the foot of the Bucegi Mountains in the picturesque town of Sinaia, Peles Castle is a masterpiece of German new-Renaissance architecture, considered by many one of the most stunning castles in Europe. Commissioned by King Carol I in 1873 and completed in 1883, the castle served as the summer residence of the royal family until 1947. Its 160 rooms are adorned with the finest examples of European art, Murano crystal chandeliers, German stained-glass windows and Cordoba leather-covered walls.</dd>
<dd>Peles Castle was the first European castle to have electricity, it even has its own power plant. The Castle has hot and cold running water, central heat and central vacuum system.
The stain glass roof of the foyer opens mechanically and there is a small elevator for the royal family. Each room is decorated in a different style or theme. There is a Concert Hall, Music Room (India), Turkish Salon, Great Salon (Italy), Council Room (Switzerland), Moor Hall, and so much more. The Royal Library has a secret door and the castle's 60-seat Theater, with royal box, showed the first movie projection in Romania in 1906. The furniture in the Music Room is carved of teak, a gift to King Carol I from the Maharajah of Kapurtala in India, while handmade silk embroideries adorn the ceiling and walls of the Turkish Salon. The ceiling paintings and decorative frescoes in the Theater Hall were designed by the renowned Austrian artists Gustav Klimt and Frantz Matsch.</dd>

  <dt><strong>2. Pelisor Castle</strong></dt>
  <dd>The castle was built in 1899–1902 by order of King Carol I, as the residence for his nephew and heir, the future King Ferdinand (son of Carol's brother Leopold von Hohenzollern) and Ferdinand's consort Queen Marie. In 2006, it was decided that the entire complex, including Pelișor, long a museum and tourist site, is the legal property of the King Michael I of Romania. The royal family was to assume legal possession of it and lease it to the Romanian state, so that it will remain in its current status.[1] The main castle of Peleș is already under lease, but negotiations for other villas and chateaus are on going. King Michael I of Romania maintained that Pelișor would remain a private residence for the royal family. Pelișor was designed by the Czech architect Karel Liman in the Art Nouveau style; the furniture and the interior decorations were designed mostly by the Viennese Bernhard Ludwig. There are several chambers, working cabinets, a chapel, and "the golden room". Queen Marie herself, an accomplished artist, made many of the artistic decisions about the design of the palace, and participated in its decoration, including as a painter. Queen Marie considered Art Nouveau a weapon against sterile historicism, creating a personal style combining Art-Nouveau elements with Byzantine and Celtic elements. The hall of honour is very simple with the walls covered with oak-timber and a glass ceiling.</dd>

  <dt><strong>3. Sinaia Monastery</strong></dt>
  <dd>Situated in the Prahova Valley, the monastery gave its name to the nearby town of Sinaia. The monastery consists of two courtyards surrounded by low buildings. In the centre of each courtyard there is a small church built in the Byzantine style. One of them—"Biserica Veche" (The Old Church)—dates from 1695, while the more recent "Biserica Mare" (The Great Church) was built in 1846. The monks possess a library that is a repository for valuable jewels belonging to the Cantacuzino family, as well as the earliest Romanian translation of the Bible, dated 1668. Take Ionescu, former Prime Minister of Romania, is buried on the grounds. The monastery consists of The Old Church and The Great one. The Old Church was built in 1695. In 2006, it was closed to begin a restoration project to return it to its former beauty. The original interior painting was completed by Pârvu Mutu and were restored for the first time in 1795. Under the leadership of Hegumens Ioasaf and Paisie, construction of The Great Church began in 1842 using funds allocated by the monastery and was completed in 1846. This smaller structure was enlarged by the Board of Civil Hospitals during a period from 1897 to 1903. These efforts gave the building the appearance it has today.</dd>

  <dt><strong>4. Sinaia Gondola</strong></dt>
  <dd>Situated in the heart of the Bucegi Mountains and reaching the highest altitude of any cable car in Romania  (2050 m), Sinaia Gondola can be seen as the transition point between sky and earth, between beautiful and spectacular. The 1000-1400 section of Sinaia Gondola starts from Furnica neighborhood, travelling to an altitude of 1400m over a distance of 1312m. This section was opened in 2007 and is served by 34 gondolas, each being able to carry up to eight people. At full capacity, this section is capable of transporting 1700 people per hour and each gondola is provided with external pockets for skis and snowboards. This new section of Sinaia Gondola establishes three national records: the installation reaches the highest altitude in Romania (2050 meters); in Valea cu Brazi area it reaches the greatest height from the ground ever recorded by an installation of this kind (120 meters) as well as crossing the steepest segment of a cable installation – 45 degrees at the first three pylons.</dd>

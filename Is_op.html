<h2><strong>Tourists opinion about Iasi</strong></h2>
<div style="font-size:20px;">
<p>Like Erol Ozan said <q>Some beautiful paths can’t be discovered without getting lost</q> ,so, let's take a look at their opinions about the city.</p>

  <dd><em>Definitely the city's premier attraction, Iasi's Palace of Culture was built in the early 20th century, and for decades served as the main law court in town. However, more recently, the Palace has been converted into a massive arts complex which serves as the focal point for Romania's Moldavian community. The Art Museum on the Palace's first floor is the centerpiece, with masterpieces by big names like Caravaggio and Veronese, but don't overlook the History Museum, with its 70,000 year-old mammoth skull. On a slightly smaller scale than the Palace of Culture, Golia is a sublime religious center at the heart of Iasi. It was built in the 16th and 17th centuries when Iasi served as the capital of an independent Moldavia, and must have cut a dash for visitors, with its soaring walls and turrets. Nowadays, it's well worth visiting for architecture buffs, but even more so for the views from the 30 meter tall Golia tower, and for the centuries-old frescoes which adorn the interior.</em></dd>

  <dd><em>One of the city's proudest creations, Iasi's Botanical Gardens can be found a few miles north of the center in the leafy Copou neighborhood, and it's definitely worth making the journey from downtown if you get the chance. Opened in 1856, it's the largest garden of its kind in Romania, sprawling over 80 hectares that are filled with Romanian species, rose beds, greenhouses, orchids, and even some fearsome carnivorous tropical species. Apart from the rich collections, its lawns and lake make the gardens one of the most serene spots in town to relax and enjoy a picnic, too. The seat of Iasi's orthodox bishopric, the Moldavian Metropolitan Cathedral is not quite what you'd expect from a church in the east. Although it has the usual cupolas (domes), the church was designed in a hybrid style, borrowing elements from Italian renaissance architects, resulting in a visually harmonious, original fusion. While you can tour the interior and see the sublime murals and statues, expect big crowds (and a vibrant atmosphere) in October when St Parascheva's relics come to town, bringing with them hordes of pilgrims.</em></dd>

   <dt><strong>An anonymus person said:</strong></dt>
   <dd><em>Forever the traveller and the wanderer, I always found Iaşi to be a restful place to stop by. I remember its cheerfulness as being entirely intellectual, presided over by the icon of my literary friends, gathered in debates and readings (...). A day spent in Iaşi was for me a discreet and finely nuanced celebration. In Iaşi I felt closer than elsewhere to the ideal place where everyone would like to spend their life. There was, in this royal city, enveloped in the melancholy of unbearably grand memories, more wit and more worship of all things intellectual than in any other Romanian centre..."
Gala Galaction – "Iasii-precum erau".</em></dd>
  <dd><em>A gorgeous 18th century building, the Roznovanu Palace has transitioned seamlessly from being a home to gilded aristocrats (and even the Romanian royal family for a brief period in 1892), to functioning as Iasi's city hall. And what a civic edifice it is. With its golden railings, interior painted ceilings and walls covered in silk drapes, it presents a cornucopia of visual delights, and visitors are always welcome.</em></dd>

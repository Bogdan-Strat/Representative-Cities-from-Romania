<h2><strong>Popular places in  Bucharest</strong></h2>
<div style="font-size:20px;">

  <dt style="font-size:20px;"><strong>1. Palace of Parliament</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Palace of the Parliament (Romanian: Casa poporului) is the seat of the Parliament of Romania, located atop Dealul Spirii in Bucharest, the national capital. The building was designed and supervised by chief architect Anca Petrescu, with a team of approximately 700 architects, and constructed over a period of 13 years (1984–97) in Socialist realist and modernist Neoclassical architectural forms and styles, with socialist realism in mind. The Palace was ordered by Nicolae Ceaușescu (1918–1989), the president of Communist Romania and the second of two longtime heads of state in power in the country since World War II, during a period in which the personality cult of political worship and adoration was noticeably increased for him and his family. Known for its ornate interior composed of 23 sections, it houses the two houses of the Parliament of Romania: the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, along with three museums and an international conference center. Though originally named the House of the Republic when under its long period of construction, after the Romanian Revolution in December 1989 it became widely known as The People's House.</dd>

  <dt><strong>2. Old Town</strong></dt>
  <dd>Known to most locals as Centru Vechi (the Old Centre), Bucharest's Old Town is defined by the area bordered by the Dambovita river to the south, Calea Victoriei to the west, Bulevardul Brătianu to the east and Regina Elisabeta to the north. The area is more or less all that’s left of pre-World War II Bucharest. What the war didn’t destroy (and it destroyed a fair bit: allied bombing was fierce during the early part of 1944) communism did, most notably in the form of the grandiose Civic Centre project that saw almost a fifth of the total area of the city flattened to make way for Bulevardul Unirii and Casa Poporului. Indeed, that anything survives at all is little short of a miracle. While much of Bucharest changed beyond recognition after 1989, nothing compared to the transformation of Old Town/Lipscani during the boom years of the late naughties, which saw what was very much a no-go area with almost nothing to offer visitors into one of the Romanian capital’s liveliest entertainment districts. Much of that development, however, was ad hoc, as is so often alas the Bucharest way: posh restaurants and trendy clubs opened in buildings which looked as though they may fall down at any moment.</dd>
<br>
  <dt><strong>3. Herastrau Park</strong></dt>
  <dd>Herastrau was laid out from 1930-36 on what had, until then, been mainly swampland around the lake. The Village Museum – which occupies a large part of Herastrau and is one of its most popular attractions in the city, was created at the same time. The lake had been a popular promenade as early as the late 19th century, however,  for the high class of Bucharest. Moreover, the residence of Romania’s royal family, the Elisabeta Palace, is found inside Herastrau. In its early days the park carried the name of its patron, King Carol II. For a short time after the second world war the park was renamed “Parcul I.V. Stalin”. The name Herastrau has been in general use since the early 1960s. It offers a multitude of choices of activities : you can rent a boat, rent a bike, visit the Japanese Garden,or have a burger at the Hard Rock Cafe.</dd>

  <dt><strong>4. Triumphal Arch</strong></dt>
  <dd>The first, wooden, triumphal arch was built hurriedly, after Romania gained its independence (1878), so that the victorious troops could march under it. Another arch with concrete skeleton and plaster exterior of elaborate sculptures and decoration designed by Petre Antonescu was built on the same site after World War I in 1922. The arch exterior, which had seriously decayed, was replaced in 1935 by the current much more sober Neoclassical design, more closely modelled in the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The new arch, also designed by Petre Antonescu and executed in stone, was inaugurated on 1 December 1936. Presently, military parades are held beneath the arch each December 1, with the occasion of Romania's national holiday.</dd>

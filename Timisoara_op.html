  <dd><em>I didn’t know much about the city, I didn’t know many people who visited it, I didn’t know what are the things to do in Timisoara.Yet when planning my Interrail trip to Romania and Bulgaria I’ve decided to go a little bit around and visit Timisoara too.Turned out to be the best decision ever!Timisoara happens to be a wonderful place for a city break and had everything I enjoy.Even if I’ve spent only 1.5 day there Timisoara almost immediately got into my very elite list of 10 favorite cities.I was leaving the city with a heavy heart, promising myself to return there when I have a chance. And one day I will! It’s really hard to put in words why I enjoyed visiting Timisoara so much. It was just a combination of these small things and lively vibe that made me click with the city.</em></dd>

  <dd><em>The first impressions of Timisoara weren’t the best. The train station and the area around are rather nondescript and the moment I saw these I started doubting my decision to visit Timisoara.But the closer I was getting to the center, the more things were looking up!Finally, the heart of Timisoara turned out to be what I like the most: mix of art nouveau and peculiar style from the Habsburg time.I was getting excited for all the Timisoara things to do that were waiting for me!I felt like a kid in the candy store when wandering around the streets of Timisoara, everything around looked so beautiful!Parts of the inner city, including the most beautiful of three main squares – Piata Unirii – were under construction but still looked colorful and just the prettiest.For some architecture gems you should definitely focus on the center and Fabric neighborhood (especially around Piata Traian).</em></dd>

   <dd><em>Charming Timisoara is often referred to as “Little Vienna,” and indeed, Austrian influences are evident in the architecture, food and culture. This is a walking city, divided into squares that showcase stunning architectural gems. Downtown is reserved for pedestrians only, and the best time to visit is at twilight, when you can sip a hot wine as you stroll amid sparkling lights.</em></dd>

   <dd><em>Why I enjoyed Timisoara so much?</em></dd>
   <dd><em>Timişoara is a compact city. You can easily see it all in a day or two. All sights are located within walking distance of each other. And if you want to explore more outside the historical center, you can take the tram. Personally, I recommend everyone to take the tram at least once, because of its retro design. There are also modern ones, but they are not as pretty as the old-timers. It can be tricky however to purchase a tram ticket. You can buy tickets at the kiosk, but not every tram stop has a ticket booth. In this case, you can check if a minimart might be selling them. It helps to remember the Romanian translation for ticket: bilet de tramvai.</em></dd>

   <dd><em>If you made it all the way here in this blog post, first of all: kudos! And secondly, time to explore the goofy side of Timişoara. What about a museum about Romanian households during the Soviet Union? That’s right, you can visit the odd Museum of the Communist Consumer to see what a household looked like in those days. Not in the mood for a museum? No worries. You can also check off all the odd statues on Timişoara’s streets. You have the Calling Boy, Superman with a tiny lady, and many more quirky statues.Speaking about art, Timişoara also offers street art. I am a big fan of cities that allow artists to add a bit of color to otherwise boring walls. Street art tells a story, and often it’s linked to the local history and culture.</em></dd>

  <dt><strong>3. Central Park</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Central Park is one of the main green spaces in Cluj-Napoca, founded in 1827. The Association for the Welfare of Women (Jóltevő Asszonyi Egyesület) rented the land to establish a recreation place. In 1830, after the completion of the landscaping works, the People's Park (Népkert) was opened to the public. Since 1860 the Park Administration has been taken over by the Park Committee led by Count Imre Mikó. Since 1865, the Sétatér-Egylet Park Association has been established, which dug the lake and built the pavilion of music. In 1871 the Skating Association rented the lake. Between 1896 and 1897, the skating pavilion and kiosk with the beautiful fountain were designed by Lajos Pákey. The skating pavilion is located on the lake and the frozen lake has been a skating rink until the early 90's.</dd>

  <dt><strong>4. Avram Iancu Square</strong></dt>
  <dd>One of the most recent squares built in Cluj, the Avram Iancu Square impresses with its monumental buildings. Here, religion and culture meet. On one side of the square is the National Opera and Theatre of Cluj, an eclectic building of the 20th century. Masterpieces like Don Juan, written by Molière or Romeo and Juliet written by Shakespeare are played on the theatre’s stage. Facing the opera is the statue of Avram Iancu and the Orthodox Cathedral. Nothing like a Catholic church, the Orthodox Cathedral reminds us of the Saint Sophia Mosque of Istanbul, a former Christian church. But what is even more impressive is the interior. Step inside and be mesmerized.</dd>

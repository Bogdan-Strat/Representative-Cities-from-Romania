  <dt><strong>1. Danube Delta</strong></dt>
  <dd>The mighty Danube River flows 1,788 miles from its springs in Germany's Black Forest to the Black Sea. Just before reaching the sea it forms the second largest and best preserved of Europe's deltas: 2,200 square miles of rivers, canals, marshes, tree-fringed lakes and reed islands. The Danube Delta is a wildlife enthusiast's (especially a bird watcher's) paradise. Travelers can spend three or more days exploring its passages, teaming with the highest concentration of bird colonies in all of Europe. The maze of canals bordered by thatch, willows and oaks entangled in lianas, offers the perfect breeding ground for countless species of birds, some of them from as far away as China and Africa. Millions of Egyptian white pelicans arrive here every spring to raise their young, while equal numbers of Arctic geese come here to escape the harsh winters of Northern Europe. Some 300 species of birds make Danube's Delta their home, including cormorants, white tailed eagles and glossy ibises.  The bird watching season lasts from early spring to late summer. Birds are not the only inhabitants of the Delta. There is also a rich community of fish and animals; from wildcats, foxes and wolves, to even an occasional boar or deer. Altogether, 3,450 animal species can be seen here, as well as 1,700 plant species.</dd>

  <dt><strong>2. Vama Veche</strong></dt>
  <dd>
It was founded in 1811 by a few Gagauz families, originally being named "Ilanlîk". Its current name literally means "Old customs", named so after Southern Dobruja (the Cadrilater) had been included in Romania in 1913. In 1940, however, that region was transferred to Bulgaria, and the village has since lain once again near the border, but the name stuck. Even in Communist Romania, Vama Veche had the reputation of a non-mainstream tourist destination, which has only grown since the Romanian Revolution of 1989. During the communist era, concern for border patrol sight lines spared Vama Veche the development that occurred in other Romanian Black Sea resorts. It became a hangout for intellectuals during the '70s when students and professors coming from the University Babeș-Bolyai of Cluj Napoca used to spend their summers here; Accommodations consisted of tents or rooms rented from peasants or fishermen. In the summer of 1988 the wife of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu (Elena Ceaușescu), discovered the village when heading to Bulgaria and decided to demolish it as it appeared to her poor and inesthetic. Some of the houses, a school and a church were destroyed, but thanks to the '89 Romanian Revolution, the village escaped from the complete demolition. Alison Mutler, Romanians Fight Over Future of Nude Beach, Associated Press, 21 August 2003. Originally on the site of Human Rights Watch, archived on Internet Archive 20 February 2006. While camping is theoretically not permitted, to this day, many visitors or semi-permanent residents still stay in tents on the beach.</dd>

  <dt><strong>3. Costinesti</strong></dt>
  <dd>During the summer season, Costinești commune becomes Costinești Resort, also known as Tineretului Resort due to its nightlife and outdoor entertainment.

For tourists passionate about diving, caving can be done at the Rapanelor Cave and at some formations dug in the underwater Sarmatian limestones. There is also a wide variety of nautical leisure facilities. The Costinesti resort is also home to student camps and yoga practitioners.</dd>

   <dd><span><strong>Main attraction: </strong></span><span><em>Wreck of the Costinesti</em></dd>
   <dd>On October 15, 1968, the current wreck at Costinesti failed about 1.5 km from the northern beach of the resort. That area of ​​the natural cliff was called the "Gulf of the French." About 12 hours before the event, the gospel crew had called for help on the radio. The people on the ship sent an SOS to the Naval Intervention and Rescue Group of the port of Constanta, announcing that it was in a state of difficulty. The first to arrive on the scene were those on the lifeboat Albatros. After a few hours, they were followed by those on the ship Voinicul. Because the crew abandoned the ship, the boat became the property of the Romanian state, according to international rules. One of the legends related to the ship says that the incident was intentionally caused by the ship's captain. He allegedly did it at the behest of the Greek shipowner Aristotle Onassis, in order to obtain compensation.</dd>

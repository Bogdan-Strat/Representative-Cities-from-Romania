<h2><strong>Popular places in Suceava</strong></h2>
<div style="font-size:20px;">
<p>A city loaded with history and culture, Suceava was the throne of the Medieval Principality of Moldavia until the 1565. You can step inside the churches where the princes were crowned and see the unconquerable fortress they built to repel the Ottomans. Suceava is also the jumping-off point for trips around the painted monasteries of Bukovina. These are eight UNESCO World Heritage churches with Byzantine architecture and beautiful murals on their outer walls. One is right here in Suceava, while the others will require a drive. But even if you stay put in Suceava there’s lots more to see, like a quaint outdoor village museum opening a window on life in the Bukovina region.</p>

  <dt style="font-size:20px;"><strong>1. Fortress of Suceava</strong></dt>
  <dd>Suceava has had an Armenian presence since the Middle Ages after they had been forced to flee their homeland during the Mongol Invasion in the 13th century. Known for their commercial prowess, in the 14th century Armenians were also offered tax exemptions to encourage them to settle in the Moldavian Principality. The Armenian monastery on a plateau at the western edge of the city dates from 1606. Within the complex is the original church, two chapels and a bell tower all defended by earthworks and a rectangular system of walls. The church retains all the regalia of an Armenian place of worship, with textiles bearing the Armenian Cross. On the nave walls are traces of frescoes and there’s wonderfully intricate stone carving in its doorways.</dd>

  <dt><strong>2. Zamca Monastery</strong></dt>
  <dd>The Table of the Silence sees a large circular stone table surrounded by twelve hourglass seats, an arrangement which can draw comparisons to the Last Supper and is sometimes referred to as the Apostles Table.The circular table is a representation of where the soldiers would have gathered, perhaps around a family table, prior to battle. It is comprised of two blocks made from limestone. The first stone has a diameter of 200cm, while the larger stone placed on top measures in with a diameter of 215cm. The hourglass chairs are not actually positioned right next to the table and symbolise time disposed. It suggests the silence of this last gathering before the looming conflict and the awareness it may be their last.</dd>

  <dt><strong>3. Cacica Salt Mine</strong></dt>
  <dd>For something out of the ordinary head 40 kilometres west to Cacica where Romania’s best salt is mined. The salt here is re-crystallised from brine and retrieved along tunnels that were first excavated by hand in 1791. There are 8,200 tunnels in all at this gigantic site, some of which are opened up to the public on 2-3-hour tour. It can be a bit unnerving to know that almost 100 metres below your feet there are miners hard at work. But things are even weirder when there’s nobody around: You’ll still be able to go down to look around an Orthodox chapel, Roman Catholic chapel, small man-made lake and, most surprising of all, a ballroom with balconies carved right from the salt.</dd>

  <dt><strong>4. Gah Syngogue</strong></dt>
  <dd>Suceava has had a Jewish population since as early as 1473, and at the beginning of the 20th century there were 18 synagogues and smaller Hasidic prayer rooms in the city. All but one of these were lost during the Second World War and ensuing communist period. The Gah Synagogue dates back to 1870 and continues to be used for services. The finest piece of decor is the mural representing the Twelve Tribes of Israel. To stay on the Jewish theme, there are two cemeteries in Suceava. The Old Cemetery is noted for the high degree of workmanship of its tombs and dates from the 1500s, while the New Cemetery has graves from the 19th and early 20th centuries.</dd>

  <dd><span><strong>Main attraction: </strong></span><span><em>Fortress of Arad</em></dd>
  <dd>The monuments found in the city mark the stages of its history, beginning with the Fortress of Arad, which was built at the time of the Empress Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II in the second half of the eighteenth century.

<br>
  <dd><span><strong>Main attraction: </strong></span><span><em>Bigar Waterfall</em></dd> 
  <dd>What makes this waterfall rare and spectacular is the way the water spring spreads over the moss of the cliff, plunging in many tiny shreds in the Minis River. Surfing to surface some 200 meters before the waterfall, the spring flows rapidly and noisy to its final destination.
Like many other natural attractions in Romania, Bigar Waterfall has its own legend, this time of a girl in love, locked by her parents in the small cave close to the falls. Desperately wanting to be with a boy named Bigar, the girl could only do that after she was transformed into a waterfall and the boy drowned in its waters.</dd>

  <dt><strong>2. Seven Stairs Canyons</strong></dt> 
  <dd>The 7 Stairs Canyon (or Seven Ladders Canyon) is a breathtaking attraction of Romania, near Brasov. The canyon is located on the west side of Piatra Mare Mountains and it is carved in Jurassic limestone. The canyon, located at 948 meters altitude, represents actually some gorges carved into chalkstone, and the name ‘Seven Stairs’ comes from the seven waterfalls that were formed as a result of the slope’s ruptures. They are the most spectacular gorges in Piatra Craiului Mountains and you can still observe traces of its recent morphological evolution. Crossing the canyon can be done through a system of nine stairways and walkways, which were fully renovated in 2013, so the safety of tourists visiting this place is 100% secured. Steps have heights between 2.5 and 15 meters and turn into waterfalls when the Seven Stairs’ creek volume boosts. There are seven waterfalls, the highest being of 35 meters. The trail inside the canyon is set up with metallic stairs and bridges. The route through the Seven Stairs Canyon can be covered in half an hour.</dd>

  <dt><strong>3. Bran Castle</strong></dt>
  <dd>Bran Castle is a castle in Bran, 25 kilometres (16 mi) southwest of Brașov. It is a national monument and landmark in Romania. The fortress is on the Transylvanian side of the historical border with Wallachia, on road DN73. Commonly known outside Romania as Dracula's Castle it is often referred to as the home of the title character in Bram Stoker's Dracula.[citation needed] There is no evidence that Stoker knew anything about this castle, which has only tangential associations with Vlad the Impaler, voivode of Wallachia, the putative inspiration for Dracula.[citation needed] Stoker's description of Dracula's crumbling fictional castle also bears no resemblance to Bran Castle. The castle is now a museum dedicated to displaying art and furniture collected by Queen Marie. Tourists can see the interior on their own or by a guided tour. At the bottom of the hill is a small open-air museum exhibiting traditional Romanian peasant structures (cottages, barns, water-driven machinery, etc.) from the Bran region </dd>
   <dd><strong>The story: </strong></dd>
   <dd>Vlad III Dracula, better known as Vlad the Impaler, was ruler of Wallachia on and off from 1448 to 1476. Other than being colloquially known as the inspiration for Bram Stoker's titular character in the novel Dracula, Vlad III is known for committing brutal acts of war. In his reign he was under constant threat of attack from both Ottoman and Hungarian forces. During an infamous retreat from Ottoman forces, Vlad III had the bodies of his enemies and his citizens alike impaled on large spikes in the field surrounding his country. Not only did his fondness for impaling his victims earn him the nickname "Vlad the Impaler", it also ensured his survival during the retreat, as the Ottoman forces returned home after seeing the grotesque scene Vlad III had prepared for them. Although Vlad III may not have ever been to Castle Bran, there is still today a strong connection between the castle and the novel Dracula, by Bram Stoker. During Stoker's research on the region of Transylvania, he came across the brutal accounts of the atrocities committed by Vlad III. It is said he directly used the name Dracula after reading on the subject, but that his inspiration for Dracula was not solely based upon the historical figure. It is said instead that it was largely due to American cinema that Vlad III is considered the primary source of inspiration for the character Count Dracula.</dd>

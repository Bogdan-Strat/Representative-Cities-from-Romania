  <dd><em>Constanța, one of the largest cities in Romania, is situated on the western shore of the Black Sea and is the largest port in Romania and one of largest in Europe. This city combines a harmonious blend of heritage of the past, legacy of the Greeks and Romans, and modern amenities. The history of Constanța began in the 7th century BC, when it was known as Tomis and was the oldest city in the Romanian territory. After its decline and complete destruction, as a result of attacks by various populations, including the Avars, the importance of the city of Tomis was confirmed after it became part of the Roman Empire, in particular during the reign of Constantine the Great, from whom the current name of the city is derived. After the rule of the Turks and following several centuries, the period of renewal of Constanța arrived only at the end of the 19th century, when the lands of Dobrogea were annexed to those of Romania.</em></dd>

  <dd><em> The variety of architectural styles in the city, due precisely to long-running cohabitation with these minorities, makes Constanța one of the most interesting cities in Romania. Historical buildings can be admired in Ovidiu Square, including the National History and Archaeology Museum and a statue of the Roman poet Ovid, who was exiled in Tomis by the Emperor Augustus. The statue was realised by the Italian sculptor Ettore Ferrari and given to the Municipality of Constanța by the Municipality of Sulmona (city of the poet).
Ovidiu Square is also site of a Roman building with mosaic and, near the square, is the Ethnography Museum. Well worth visiting is the Orthodox Cathedral, dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, built between 1884 and 1895. Nearby archaeological remains of ancient Tomis have been found.</em></dd>
